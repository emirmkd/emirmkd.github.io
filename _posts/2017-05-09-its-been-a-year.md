<p>So... yeah... I actually moved to Dubai. <br>
That's something that's been coming along for a pretty long time. So long that it actually started becoming unreal, like it's never gonna happen. Enough about that, off to the fun stuff:<br></p>
<h3>Salesforce! Or "How I became a Salesforce Admin"</h3>
<p>Officially, Salesforce is a Cloud CRM Solution. CRM stands for "Customer Relationship Management". This means that Salesforce will help you manage the relationships with your customers in every sense: everything from communications, to signed deals and discounts, marketing activities, etc. It's a great and powerful tools in the right hands. <br>
From my university studies, I've learned what these tools are meant to do, but never had any actual experience until I landed my first job in my second year of uni. I only used this tool for about a month, not as an Administrator, but as a sales person. It seemed interesting, but also really complicated (I wasn't wrong). I used it to make semi-automated calls, or more specifically, I was cold-calling people. <br>
Fast-forward around 4 years later and I land my first job in Dubai as a Marketing Executive. The job description didn't include Salesforce, but I was asked if I knew something about it on the interview. Being a techie, I never say I don't know how to use some software or hardware, I just say that I haven't had enough experience with it. At the moment, I wouldn't have thought that within weeks, I would become the Salesforce administrator...<br>
As I said, the job was "Marketing Executive", as I really like marketing (well, maybe I should rephrase that to: I absolutely hate marketing and it's mind-altering tools, but I really find it fascinating and I decided to learn how it works, so that I can be immune to it and possibly change it for the better one day) and I had some previous experience in the field. I soon learned that Salesforce was so deeply rooted in how the company functions, that it would be impossible to not have someone maintain it. In my studies, I was taught that if a system like this isn't maintained, the tool becomes a loaded gun in the hands of a trigger-happy 4 year old child. It's just a matter of time before someone loses a finger, or worse, loses a client. <br>
Being the curious cyber cat (I can't believe I actually used "cyber"), I used my free time to go through each and every feature of Salesforce. 3 months later and I'm still stuck on one feature... <br>
<strong>Salesforce has a LOT of features!</strong><br>
Seriously. A lot. And I was fascinated by how flexible it is. On the other hand, the system has so many moving parts that it makes it super easy for something to go horribly wrong. In hindsight, I probably should've tested everything in a sandbox, <strong>BEFORE</strong> pushing it to the live/production version. Thankfully, I was smart enough or lucky enough not to f**k something up.
