<p>So, it's been some time since I posted on this blog, but I've decided to change it up a bit. I've started a "proper" WordPress blog with a new domain: emiralkafadji.com. I think that domain will continue to be my main domain and blog.</p>
<p>The blog will be all about marketing (until I change my mind and start posting about other things). It will include everything you might think Digital Marketing includes.</p>
<p>If this sounds interesting to you, it's time to follow my new blog!</p>
