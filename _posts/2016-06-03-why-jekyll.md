<p class="postdescription">Some of you may wonder why I chose to make this blog on GitHub pages with Jekyll. Well, I learned about Jekyll a while ago, together with the information that you can host your website on GitHub for free.</p>

I thought it was interesting but never really got around to it. A week or two ago, I found out about GitHub's <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Student Pack!</a><br>

Fortunately for me, I am still a student, so I got the offer and it gave me a sh*tton of things <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/dARUXSVNXc5Da/giphy.gif">FOR FREE!</a> In the meantime, my university exams were coming to an end and I also quit my job. This was the perfect time to learn new things and to expand my knowledge about computers, websites, maybe learn how to code. I decided to make a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BF9CtZXhEYh/?taken-by=g33k.mk">list</a> to keep track. Thinking that the best way to learn is to explain what you're learning to someone, I thought it might be a good idea to blog about this "journey" as I go through it.
<h2> Day 1</h2>
Time to see what I need to set up Jekyll and how to make my blog. I began by visiting the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">official Jekyll website</a> and reading through the documentation, but to be honest I was a bit lost. At first, I thought I needed to set up Jekyll locally and that turned out to be a pain since I'm on Windows, while Jekyll requires Linux or MAC OS (I have neither available). So I installed <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle VM VirtualBox</a> together with <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=203">Linux Mint "Rosa", 32-bit Cinnamon</a> Downloaded all the required stuff, like Ruby, NodeJS, etc. and only <b>THEN</b> did I find out that I didn't actually need to do all that! Thanks to this <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">other tutorial</a> I found (I think it was linked on the Jekyll page somewhere), I realized that I can just write the things I need directly in GitHub. This tutorial really helped! <br>
<h3>I followed the tutorial and lo and behold, my new blog was born!</h3>
So far, it's just a bit of basic code to have some kind of structure, with minimal CSS styling, but I intend to use JavaScript, try new HTML5 and CSS3 things and hopefully, I won't be too lazy to blog about it :)
Oh, and I added some tags, so I can show off my blog on Facebook properly!
